	<h1>Maldives</h1><br>
	<p>This unique archipelago off the coast of East Africa is a portfolio of turquoise-blue waters, palm-tree lined beaches with sand as white as snow, and luxury villas and all-inclusive resorts. Due to the fantastic clarity of the water and active marine life, scuba diving and snorkelling are popular activities on the islands: if youâ€™re lucky, you may even get to swim with manta rays and dolphins! But most breathtakingly of all, is the Malivan sunset: sit in one of the many seafront restaurants and enjoy the spectacular views and hues of the golden sun as it sets over the Indian ocean.</p>
